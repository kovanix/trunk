Character config filename options
There's several ways to name a character config file. List in order of priority (formats higher in the list will override lower ones):

1 Custom Config (see below)

2 Class.Profile.js - Profile matches D2Bot# profile. This makes it possible to assign different configs to the same character.
Just make 2 profiles that use the same character and 2 character config in this format.
Examples: Paladin.MFer.js, Paladin.Rusher.js

3 Realm.Class.Charname.js - This is used when botting on multiple realms with same character name.
Examples: Europe.Sorceress.MyChar.js, USEast.Sorceress.MyChar.js

4 Class.Charname.js - This is the default format.
Examples: Sorceress.MyChar.js, Druid.Sorceress.MyOtherChar.js

5 Profile.js - Similar to 1 but without Class prefix. This is used for generic characters where class doesn't matter (Follower, Wakka, AutoBaal etc.).
Examples: Follower1.js, Follower2.js
